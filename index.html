        collaborate real time, building virtual scenes with people next to them
        or in different countries. They'll be able to iterate freely and easily
        to make their stories better.

      <h2>1. Story Development</h2>
      <p>
        The story is the most important part of visual storytelling. Does that
        statement sound as basic to you as it feels for me to write it? I hope
        so, because it should be plain as day.

        ability to contrive a story from nothing, infuse it with love and soul,
        solve it's infinite potential issues, and economically have an emotional
        impact on the viewer, all while seeming true and not contrived is a

        Certainly, you've seen a big budget movie where it was technically
        astounding, but the story just sucked. What's the point of burning tons
        of production cash if the story sucks? Why not wait until you have fully
        developed the story?
      </p>

      <p>Probably because making stories is hard, and people are lazy.</p>

      <p>
        Therefore, the development of the story should be the greatest interest
        of visual storytellers all the way through production, and even after
        it.
      </p>
      <h2 id="writing-visually">
        <a class="header-anchor" href="#writing-visually">¶</a> Writing Visually
      </h2>
      <p>
        If we consume visual stories as images, why would a writer use words to
        describe images to synthesize a story? Why not develop a story visually?
        Instead of writing with words, write with images.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s easy to understand why we write with words. We use collections of
        words as symbols to create ideas. We can speak and listen to words to
        communicate ideas. We can write words down and read them. We can easily
        mass distribute written words. Words are cheap and effective. But they
        are also lossy symbols. They can never exactly convey the true meaning
        and feeling of the writer. They require the writer to translate the idea
        to words, and the reader to translate the words to the idea. Those are
        two translations where the original idea can be confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        In animation, specifically at a company like Pixar, writers do, in fact,
        write with images. “Story Artists” draw sequences of images to convey
        stories. Storyboards. This is an incredibly effective way of conveying a
        story because the hand drawn images are very close to the desired end
        product. Story artists can visably explain ideas understood immediately,
        which would be very difficult to write in words. Image sequences also
        demonstrate timing, pacing and tone, which is often near impossible to
        do in words.
      </p>
      <p>
        The downside of drawing images to synthesize stories is that you need to
        be able to draw. However, I have been assured by many story artists that
        the important component of “Story Artist” is “Story”. A great
        storyteller who has little drawing ability can put together stick figure
        drawings and is able to move a viewer emotionally. Conversely, a
        technically great illustrator with no clear idea of story often just
        makes hollow pretty pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, I believe great visual storytellers
        <strong>should</strong> be able to visually write without having the
        ability to draw. This is why we built Storyboarder. Initially,
        Storyboarder was built as a conventional storyboarding tool centered
        around illustration. Yet, computers have a great ability to render 3D
        scenes of environments, objects, and characters. So we built a tool that
        allows people to easily create scenes, pose characters and set up
        cameras so they can easily create images to tell stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, you can put on a VR headset to create and manipulate the
        whole scene just as you would in a real set. It essentially allows you
        to write and direct a story on the fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Editing is very easy by going back into a scene and making changes.
        There isn’t a sense of loss of throwing away a drawing – there is a
        sense of productivity and creativity by incrementally making things
        better.

        “Film stories are still really rooted in theater. You’re frequently
        stuck doing things that you could do much more poetically. The story has
        to be written for it and I’m not quite sure who would do it because
        writers don’t write visual things.” – Stanley Kubrick
      </p>
      <p>
        With modern creative tools, it’s now possible for writers to write
        visual things.
      </p>
      <p>
        So at this point, there is no reason why a visual storyteller should not
        be writing visually using a tool like Storyboarder or any other tool
        that works for them.

      <h2 id="importance-of-play">
        <a class="header-anchor" href="#importance-of-play">¶</a> Importance of
        Play
      </h2>
      <p>
        All of the most creative things I’ve ever done have been by accident. I
        was trying something I didn’t need to do because: why not? I was
        playing. With curiosity and wonder you take little low cost risks to see
        what will happen. You learn new things. Sometimes those things are
        fantastic. Sometimes you are the first person to discover something and
        often the first to discover it from your particular point of view.
      </p>
      <p>Keep the costs low and the creative risks high.</p>
      <p>
        When creating or doing something takes a lot of effort or has a big
        expense, we don’t take small risks. We make plans. We make plans to make
        plans. We often spend more time trying to mitigate the potential
        disasters of the plan than actually executing. This limits happy
        accidents. This limits risk taking. This limits play.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s weird and sad how people don’t play as they get older. Maybe it’s
        because our bodies work slower. Maybe it’s because we think we’ve
        already discovered everything. Maybe it’s because we don’t even remember
        the joy of discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it possible to live in the world of your story? Is it possible to act
        the scene out?
      </p>
      <p>
        When Walt Disney was developing the story of Snow White, he would grab a
        random employee from the halls and bring them to the theater. He would
        act out the full story of Snow White from his head. Every time was a
        little different. He would try different ideas and often improvise new
        ideas on the spot. He did this hundreds of times, coming up with tons of
        new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why not play the story out hundreds of times? Improvise new ideas
        because: why not?
      </p>
      <p>
        When the cost to try new ideas is low, and the technology and tooling
        blend into the background, you can reach a flow state. You are hyper
        focused on creation. You can try new things and you get immediate
        feedback. New ideas give you new ideas. The instant you have to wait for
        something, this is broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        When creation feels like a game, the stakes are low. The barrier is low.
        The risks are easy to take. The art is better.
      </p>
      <h2 id="collaboration">
        <a class="header-anchor" href="#collaboration">¶</a> Collaboration
      </h2>
      <p>
        Creativity is reactive. No one synthesizes a completely original idea
        without prompt. The conversations between people are people reacting to
        each others ideas. A question is asked for clarification. A person
        responds with a new thought they’d never thought of before. Another
        person brings a fact or prior art into the conversation sparking new
        ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversation and collaboration between people is an excellent tool for
        synthesizing new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, recent story development is thought of as a solitary act. The sole
        writer creates a unique, idiosyncratic story with their own take on
        dramatic conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        A strong, unique point of view is absolutely necessary in a story. But
        why not benefit from multiple minds of similar style, interest and
        taste, each bringing their own strengths to the development of the
        story? With a strong central story director, the story can maintain the
        point of view, while incorporating the very best input from each writer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, collaborators don’t need to be in the same place. In fact,
        it seems absurd to find creative, unique, talented people (which is near
        impossible), expecting they will all live in the same city. We have
        tools to coexist in virtual worlds together, walking around, playing,
        and creating together. You can do this within Storyboarder.

      <p>
        Some of the most beautiful stories are told through music. Some of the

      </p>
      <p>
        So why not develop a story with music as a fundamental writing tool in
        the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
        Music and thoughtful sound design have a huge impact on how people feel
        when they watch a visual story. Music can set the mood and tone through
        the usage of well known cliches. In fact, in the absence of a meaningful
        story, music is the only hope to keep that visual turd from sinking into
        the dark abyss of irrelevance.

      <h2 id="iteration">
        <a class="header-anchor" href="#iteration">¶</a> Iteration
      </h2>
      <p>
        Iteration is easily the most important concept around the future of
        visual storytelling. I buried it down here because most people aren’t
        even reading this far. But you are. Hey. Isn’t this nice? Let’s just
        take a moment to appreciate each other. Thanks for reading this.
        Anyways…
      </p>
      <p>
        No creation is great right out of the gate. It is made better over time.
        You listen to feedback. You change things. You try new things or gain a
        new perspective. You change things. Every iteration makes the work
        better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iteration is how stories have historically developed. Myths would be
        created by someone and told to a group of people. People would retell
        the stories, keeping the best aspects of the story and losing the worst
        parts. Every time it was retold, it would be slightly different, each
        time, the story would be iterated on. The bible is a great example of a
        collection of prototypical myths iterating over several thousand years.
        All religious mythology and folklore is the result of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        In video game development, no game is just made and released to the
        public. When a game designer has a novel idea for a game, they are
        feeling pretty good that they are on to something. They make a
        prototype. They make something people can play and receive feedback on.
        This isn’t done two or three times. This is done thousands of times.
        When the game is ready for release, perhaps a kernel of the vision is
        still intact, but the resulting game is very different from the way they
        originally intended. Even after release, changes are being made to
        improve the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        In feature-length narrative screenwriting, there is some sort of
        arbitrary “A draft and two revisions” rule of thumb. It seems to be
        centered around worker protectionism more than the work itself. But who
        really gives a shit about how screenwriting is typically done? Mythology
        has been iterating on iconic stories for 10,000 years. Screenwriting has
        only existed for roughly a hundred years and has produced only a handful
        of rare single hit successes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet in animation, particularly at Pixar, stories are heavily iterated
        on. Animation is much more expensive per minute to produce than
        live-action. Therefore, if you are going to spend a ton on production,
        you should invest in the story you are trying to produce. Stories at
        Pixar start with the kernel of an idea. The story is workshopped. Scenes
        are written by story artists that produce visual sequences to pitch
        story ideas to the team and the director. Because these hand drawn
        sequences can be edited into full versions of a movie, Pixar can show
        that version to test audiences and their trusted panel of storytellers
        for feedback. The feedback is taken and incorporated into revisions of
        sequences, or even wholly new ideas. This makes the stories better.
        Pixar stories are developed over the course of two years. Their story
        and commercial hit rate is nearly 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though Pixar literally invented computer graphics, their most
        valuable innovation has been how they iterate on story. I don’t know why
        every storyteller or entertainment studio hasn’t stolen their process. I
        think it is because Pixar originated as a group of creative software
        engineers. The value of technological iteration is burned into their
        culture. Whereas most other creative executives still cling to the
        golden touch fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        But iteration is hard particularly in visual storytelling because the
        costs are so high. Do you have 10 story artists at your disposal to
        visualize your story concepts? I don’t. Furthermore, changes to stories
        have ripple effects. If you change a fundamental value of a character in
        the story, you have to make sure that change is reflected in the rest of
        the story. This problem increases exponentially based on the length of
        the story. Even worse, artists are resistant to losing their work.
        Imagine if you just drew a beautiful sequence of 300 images. But, a
        great change was made to a character that will improve the story. This
        will nullify your sequence and it must be redone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why we built Storyboarder. We wanted scenes and shots to be
        easily changed so that contrary to feeling loss while iterating story,
        you would feel a sense of improvement. A creative tool like Storyboarder
        will reduce the change costs so that iteration is pain free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, because the storyboard sequences generated with Storyboarder are
        very similar to the desired output (a visual story), full sequences of
        the entire visual story can be presented to test audiences for feedback.
        This can be done hundreds or thousands of times.

      <p>
        Pre-production is the stage where the story has been developed enough
        that it makes sense to move forward and prepare for production. However,
        this doesn’t mean the story is done. Ideally, through the process
        working with the cast, workshopping the story, and further testing, the
        story will further develop prior to production. Through the step of
        proto-production, the story will be iterated on at least one more time.

        There are a lot of great actors few people have seen yet. If your story
        is great, you do not need a well-known actor. If the cost of your
        production is low, you do not need a well-known actor to sell your story
        to viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Culturally, you want your actors on your team. You want them fully
        invested in the story. You want them to make your story ring true. You
        want them to be able to iterate on the story with you. You want them to
        make the story better.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will take more work than usually required of a typical narrative
        story. It’s important that they are willing to do this.

        Bring the actors together to perform alongside the storyboard animatic
        and record the voices. In the sessions, if the actors have concerns or
        ideas, talk them through and try new things if needed. Afterwards, sync
        the vocal performances to the storyboard animatic. The result should be
        very compelling. If it’s not, the story or the performances have issues.

      </h2>
      <p>
        A proto-production is a low cost prototype of a visual story. In
        software or game development terms, it would be like a beta test.
      </p>
      <p>Shoot the movie before shooting the movie.</p>
      <p>
        The objective is to shoot the entire visual story without built-up sets,
        crew, tight time constraints, or high costs. Think: a large warehouse. A
        couple moveable walls, platforms, tables and chairs. The actors, the
        writers, and you – with a camera. You’ll shoot the whole story there.
        For months if you need to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a fully edited visual story that can be viewed by anyone.
        If the visual story doesn’t move your viewers emotionally, it’s not
        because there aren’t built sets or fancy visual effects. It’s because
        your story sucks and or your performances are bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wouldn’t it suck to find out your story really just isn’t working? No
        one is feeling it. Even you. That’s what releasing the first prototype
        of a game is like. But it’s not a bad thing. It’s incredibly eye opening
        and a huge opportunity to make things better.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ve already visually written your story and iterated on it many
        times. You shouldn’t even be shooting a proto-production if you weren’t
        confident in your animatic. So it should be very clear what’s not
        working with this proto-production and what needs to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was talking to a well-known movie actor about the idea of a
        proto-production. He told me that he actually prefers acting in theater.
        However, he won’t sign on to a theatrical production unless he has the
        time to devote two full months to workshopping the play. When he signed
        on, he liked the story of the script. He wouldn’t have if he didn’t. But
        he describes the first day of workshop as having a feeling that this
        really isn’t going to work. Yet, through everyone’s feedback, iterating
        with the director, the script changes, it becomes really good. And even
        still, on opening night, there will be a line in the play, that no one
        in the production ever thought twice about, that gets a huge laugh. And
        they will change the script to lean into that laugh a bit more. It’s an
        incredibly rewarding experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        That same actor will be in a movie where he isn’t even allowed to read
        the whole script, but what he is reading seems like trash. He’ll ask
        producers and the directors about it and they will assure him that
        everything is going to be great. He shows up that day for the shoot.
        Does his lines. Waits a year. He was right. The story was trash.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a technical basis, we want to make tools that make much of the
        technical aspects of production invisible. We want to focus on the story
        and the performances, but in order to keep costs down, we won’t have a
        crew.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire visual story was storyboarded shot for shot in Storyboarder.
        Each board has tons of metadata: the characters in the shot, what they
        are doing, where the camera is, what the lens is, etc. So there is a
        shot list for the whole story. You can shoot to the storyboards in this
        case, and avoid shooting coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built a system called “Shot Core” that imports all of your shots and
        metadata for the story. The shots can be reordered into a schedule. When
        you pick up the camera, it shows you the storyboard of the shot you
        should be shooting. When you record a take, Shot Core logs it and
        shuttles it automatically off the camera. There’s a small device
        attached to the camera that lets you rate a take or advance to the next
        shot. As you are shooting a scene, Shot Core automatically assembles a
        rough edit of the scene in real time. The whole system is designed to
        keep you on track, organized, and not worry about anything except the
        story.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to shoot anything different, you can make impromptu shots.
        You can even rework the whole scene with no problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s important for the technical aspects of shooting a proto-production
        to be extremely flexible because you are also workshopping the story. If
        an actor improvises a line that sparks a new idea, it should be
        explored. If there is a clear problem, it’s important to pause, work it
        out, and try potential solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result should be very compelling. If it’s not, the story or the
        performances have issues. Make changes. Shoot a proto-production again
        if needed.

        Tyler Perry makes a series of movies starring his character, Madea. The
        movies are a series of situational comedy sketches targeted to Black
        audiences. Tyler Perry will randomly show up to local night theaters in
        Atlanta and try new sketch ideas on stage. If the sketch doesn’t do well
        with the Black audience, he might come back the next night after
        revising the sketch. And if it kills, that sketch will probably be in
        the next Madea movie. Tyler Perry is a creative genius. He tests his
        stories and iterates on them in near real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a central theme to the future of visual storytelling, it is
        that trying, doing, testing, changing and repeating is extremely
        important to story development. The process started small and low cost,
        but you were able to take huge creative risks. With each iteration you
        were able to improve the story as the costs become greater.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result of each iterative step should be compelling. If it’s not,
        there’s a big problem. There’s no sense moving on to the next step and
        going through the final step of costly production. It’s an idiotic waste
        if you can’t fix those issues earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you get feedback, you can translate the feedback into real ideas
        and make changes on the story. This is key to iterating on story and
        making it better.
      </p>
      <p>
        But how do you know if the story is good or improving? In Tyler Perry’s
        case, he is performing to his targeted audience for laughs. When he gets
        laughs, it’s passing the test. When he gets huge laughs, he surpasses
        his expectation. And when he gets no laughs, something is very wrong.
        Certainly he thought it might work if he tried it. But he took a risk
        and it didn’t work out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your taste and your point of view are the most important components to
        telling a visual story with an idiosyncratic, unique point of view.
        Luckily, because of this, you mostly know when things are rotten. But
        you don’t know exactly how your target audience is going to react to the
        story risks you’ve taken. And that’s the job: to entertain them.
        Therefore, if you can get their feedback and incorporate it into story
        changes, you’ll be very successful at entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will only be producing your visual story once. So make sure the
        proto-production has been well tested before moving ahead.

      </h2>
      <p>
        Concurrent to proto-production, you have to prepare everything you need
        for production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of advancements in compute speed and game development, scenes
        can be shot using virtual environments and composited with the real
        performances of the actors. This allows us to shoot in locations that
        are impossible or don’t exist, and in many cases, it is just cheaper to
        shoot virtually. Therefore, we need to design those virtual
        environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        3D designs of the sets need to be created, textured, and lit properly.
        This doesn’t need to be super high quality or exact, because you can
        make changes to the environment in post compositing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the most important aspect is the lighting, because when the actors
        are photographed, the lights on them will be physically reflected from
        the virtual world. Luckily, lighting is very easy to change in realtime,
        in production.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, anything the actors touch needs to be built. This means that if an
        actor touches a wall, you need to build that wall. If they pick
        something up, that needs to be a real thing. If they walk on the floor,
        the floor needs to be dressed.

        the easiest aspect of the entire process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective is: Photograph and record the actors’ performance of the
        story from intentional camera angles. Collect all the appropriate
        technical information needed to composite that photography for the final
        image in post production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every person on the production team should be contributing creatively
        with the shared vision of the best version of the story. Culturally, it
        shouldn’t feel like time is running out. Everyone is on the same team
        and no one is killing themselves to get stuff done. It’s a relaxed
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology is used to help accomplish technical tasks that blend into
        the background. There are fewer technical people, which means a reduced
        cost of production which means longer time to capture the best
        performance of the story.

        Paul Thomas Anderson recalls meeting Stanley Kubrick after Paul made
        Boogie Nights:
      </p>
      <p>
        “We talked about the size of his crew. Cause he had like 6 people. And I
        go, “Wow you know you have a small crew,” and he’s like, “Well how many
        do you use?” You know it was one of those moments where you really have
        to assess like, “Like a fucking hundred,” and that’s too many. And he
        made a very good point.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Stanley Kubrick was a curious autodidact who surrounded himself with
        small group of similar autodidacts. If he was interested in something,
        he learned it. His attitude was that nothing is impossible or too
        complex to learn. He wrote, directed, photographed, designed,
        engineered, edited, and was probably also a great break dancer. Because
        his crew had similar skills and everyone was intimately aware of his
        sense of taste and style, he was able to delegate tasks to autonomous,
        creative, intelligent people that would get shit done.
      </p>

        Additionally, they embraced technology that made their jobs easier so
        they could extend their productions for the purpose of capturing story.

        agile development. One component of TPS is that any single person in the

      <p>
        In entertainment production, I often hear that anything that can go
        wrong, will go wrong. I don’t feel that way when I’m using my phone. I
        don’t feel that way when I’m using my computer. I don’t feel that way
        when I’m playing a game. Yet, when people are talking about capturing
        performances on a technical basis, this seems to be the story. I think
        it is because the tools that are used are poorly designed and rely too
        much on human operation. Humans doing technical tasks has a huge
        propensity for error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology should be built that removes technical tasks from people so
        they can focus on story and performances. Good user interface design
        simplifies the complicated technical task for the creative user so they
        can freely create with very little friction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical entertainment production does not invest in technology. They buy
        taped together ad-hoc tools. They do not design tools. They do not build
        tools. They do not envision the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology should not be developed by a cottage industry of high margin
        businesses to be sold at a yearly trade show. Technology should be
        designed with specific purpose by the creative artists themselves and
        ideally shared with other creators.

        <a class="header-anchor" href="#virtual-production">¶</a> Virtual
        Production
      </h2>
      <p>
        Virtual Production is a concept that describes producing photography
        where at least part of the image was generated by a computer, in real
        time. A simple example of this is: Shooting an actor against a green
        screen and 3D tracking the camera’s position and rotation in real time,
        so you can composite the actor on top of a 3D rendered background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Greenscreening and matte painting have been used for the past 60 years
        to put actors in environments that would previously be impossible or too
        expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference now is that the actors can move around in the space, in
        real time, reacting to the the virtual environment. The director can
        move the camera around and see the composition of the shot as they are
        shooting it. The actors and director can try things in the space. They
        can play in the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disney’s The Jungle Book was a great example of one of the first
        productions that used a realtime game engine to visualize virtual sets.
        The director of Jungle Book, Jon Favreau, has really embraced the
        concept of virtual production. In his subsequent TV series, The
        Mandalorian, he uses a full LED walled environment for many of his
        scenes. The LED walls give the actors a sense of their environment, but
        more importantly the LED lights are used to light the actors
        realistically, as if they are in the real scene. So if the scene was on
        a sunset beach, they would be lit golden from the side, and cool and
        dark from the other. In 3D terms, this is called Global Illumination, or
        GI. Lack of GI in 3D rendering is was makes 3D look so fake. And having
        real GI on actors is what makes the Mandalorian’s virtual scenes look so
        real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, because they are completely surrounded by LEDs, they can
        use the real time camera position and rotation of the camera to project
        the frustrum of the camera as a green box behind the actors. The green
        box is only as big as the camera sees. Because it’s small, it reduces
        the amount of green light bouncing off the actors. This is very smart,
        because even though they are using a virtual set to light the actors and
        visualize the shots, they can still change the details of the virtual
        worlds later in post production.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, it would really suck if you had to design immensly detailed 3D
        worlds ahead of production knowing that you might not even end up
        shooting parts of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some problems with the Mandalorian LED wall enclosure is that the
        installation of such a huge scale enclosure is difficult. The cost of
        the led wall material is incredibly expensive and it generates a ton of
        heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the ideal virtual production system would be something that:
        is cheap, relatively easy to set up, provides photographic global
        illumination of the actors, and is easy to segment actors out of the
        image to be composited on a virtual world.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if, instead an LED wall enclosure, the scene was surrounded by
        disparate remote controlled led light panels? You could place many of
        them around the periphery of the scene, loosely pointing at the center
        of the scene. A 360 degree camera placed in the center of the scene
        could perform a calibration procedure to get the exact position of each
        light, and as a result, the virtual world could be sampled to tell the
        light the exact color and intensity to emit. The result would be a very
        approximate, cheaper form photographic of GI.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for masking out the actors from the background for compositing, what
        if instead of visible light, infrared light was used? Humans can
        percieve IR light, so it is invisible, so it can be used in smart ways
        to contain information. Remote controls work with IR light. VR
        controllers use IR light so they can be tracked by IR cameras. What if
        you had 2 identical cameras with the same lens? One would allow only IR
        to pass through, and the other would only allow visible light. Using a
        mirror, you capture both images. If you flooded the actors from the
        camera with infrared light, you would be able to use the infrared image
        as the alpha channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even simpler, if you were able to capture infrared light as a seperate
        channel as rgb on the same camera sensor, the setup would be even more
        elegant.
      </p>
      <p>
        This solution assumes real photography is necessary. In the future, it
        won’t be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine that your scene has been all storyboarded out. Why can’t an
        actor just put on a lightweight vr headset that allows them to walk
        around freely in the space? The headset would track their body movement,
        and their facial expressions perfectly. Other actors could be in the
        same virtual space, coexisting, interacting with each other. Yet, they
        wouldn’t have to be in the same physical space. The director and the
        other collaborators could be in the space. They could manipulate the
        scene, moving objects, directing actors, moving cameras. The entire
        production could be produced virtually. Also, because the facial
        expressions and voice could be transferred to any virtual likeness, the
        appearance of the actors could be anyone or anything. But most
        interestingly, because each character could be played by the same
        person, an entire production could be dreamed of, developed, directed,
        performed and produced by a single person.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you ignore visual fidelity, that future is already now. Within 5
        years, this type of production will be indistinguishable from reality.

        While we are still stuck in physical reality, the ability to move things
        and articulate them in physical space is really important. If I’m a
        single person making a youtube video, I have to move the camera into the
        position I want it. I have to pan and tilt it to make sure the framing
        is good. If I move too much, I might be out of the frame, ruining the
        shot without another person to articulate the camera. In the future, I
        should be able to at least remotely control the position and rotation of
        the camera. Given the simple rules, I should let the camera operate
        itself, panning as I move. As a game developer, I would be able to make
        the autonomous movements of a 3D camera like that in 20 minutes. Why
        can’t I build that today?
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the past 2 years, robotics have gotten much cheaper. Sensing
        objects and environments in 3D has gotten much better and additionally
        cheaper.
      </p>
      <p>
        So imagine a camera, attached to a robotic arm, mounted to a base
        platform. The base platform can move in any direction. The arm has 6
        base points of articulation so the end of the arm can be in any x, y, z
        position and any x, y, z rotation within it’s reach. At the end of the
        arm is the camera, which is remotely controlled as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of moving the camera, you pick up your phone. Through your
        phone, you see the what the camera sees. Your phone is able to track
        it’s own position in 3D space, so the position and rotation of your
        phone can be translated to the relative position and rotation of the
        robot camera. You might even have specific constraints, like only move
        along a predefined line, or orbit around a specific point in space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, you would be able to record very specific camera movements
        that could be played back perfectly, every time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But most importantly, you could tell it how to perform as a semi
        autonomous camera. For example, you could frame the shot that you want,
        but you could tell it that you wanted to keep a particular subject in a
        particular part of the frame, allowing for a little wiggle room, but no
        sudden camera movements, and apply a human handheld type camera shake.
        Or you might want the camera to dolly slowly, keeping 2 characters in
        the 2/3rd of the screen no matter how much they move.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is really easy to build in a virtual model (video game), but not
        all that difficult to build using robots and current technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think about putting physical movement in additional things like
        lights, you can imagine a concept of dynamic sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if you wanted to go from one predefined setup to another? You could
        just advance the shot, and all of the lights would move to their new
        positions and the camera would move to its position and the shot would
        be ready to shoot in a minute.

        Why aren’t you editing your scene together as it’s being shot? Our tool,
        Shot Core, does a rough assembly edit in real time as you shoot. But why
        not really edit the scene together before you move onto the next scene?
        The whole scene is right there, and you can reshoot or try something
        different if you want. Bong Joonho does this. It’s some basic no duh

        With heavy use of virtual production, the primary set of work is around
        visual compositing.

        To minimize the expense of visual compositing, editing has to be
        completed first.
      </p>
      <h2 id="compositing">
        <a class="header-anchor" href="#compositing">¶</a> Compositing
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because most of the photographed scenes in the visual story are shot
        with virtual production, almost every shot of the story needs to be
        composited. This basically means the video clips of the actors need to
        be masked so that the background is removed, that needs to be composited
        on top of a video of the virtual world generated from the position of
        the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, we need the camera track. We have the data from the 3D tracking
        device attached to the top of the camera during shooting. We take that
        data and also perform an optical camera track using only the video. The
        reality is that the optical camera track will work better in most cases
        because it is frame perfect. The 3D tracking device is more physically
        accurate, however there is noise in the data. Combining the best of both
        yields an excellent track that can be fed into the renderer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we were recording a 3D depth sensor next to the camera. This gives
        us the distance between the camera and the actors or objects in the
        camera. For rendering, we will know the specific depth that we want to
        set focus. We will render everything behind the plane on that particular
        depth, and then everything in front of that depth.
      </p>
      <p>We will use those two images to sandwich the image of the actors.</p>
      <p>
        Next, we need to isolate the actors. We can use the separate IR image as
        the mask. It needs to be calibrated per frame to match the visible light
        image perfectly. The contrast of the image should be boosted so that the
        actors are white and the background is black. Then, any black holes need
        to be filled with white. Any great errors need to be hand painted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, this work will be done automatically. Put in the information,
        get out a rendered shot. Errors in the shots could be spot checked and
        manually fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other artistic composition elements can be placed, like dynamic volumes
        (fog, steam, explosions).

      <p>
        AI or Machine Learning has produced some really interesting visual
        research in the past few years. Unfortunately, currently, most novel
        example demos are unuseable on a practical basis. But there is some work
        that could be used procedurally that would speed up work by a ton. One
        really great example are “deep fakes” or face replacement. The quality
        is excellent and the technique can currently be used to do face
        replacement much faster and cheaper than manually compositing 3D face
        renderings ontop of video.
      </p>
      <p>The areas that I think AI will particularly interesting are:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rotoscoping</strong> - Masking subjects out of a video. In ML,
        this is usually called image segmentation or background removal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Relighting</strong> - Take an existing video and change the
        position of the light sources to relight the video.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Face replacement</strong> - Replace a video clips face with an
        existing face model.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Performance replacement</strong> - Take an existing shot with a
        performance and camera movement, and replace the performance matching
        the existing style of the video.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dynamic retiming</strong> - Independantly retime performance
        from camera movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Speech Editing / Speech Synthesis</strong> - Change words in a
        sentence in a performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Audio Cleanup</strong> - Eliminate background from noisy
        recordings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Audio style matching</strong> - Given an existing recording of a
        voice actor, match the style with a new actor’s voice.

        Visual Storytellers want their visual stories to be seen by the most
        targeted people. Everyone watches visuals on their phones, computer, or
        tvs through the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the cost of production being much lower, you can specifically
        target groups that were typically considered niche, better serve that
        audience, and make a market that previously didn’t exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, great stories are universal. If your story is great, you transcend
        your initial audience to much wider appeal.

        I don’t understand why the first act of every movie isn’t on Youtube. I
        don’t understand why the first episode of every TV show isn’t on
        Youtube. Everyone is on Youtube looking to watch something that connects
        with them. The first act of a movie sets up the world, introduces the
        character(s) in that world and then, BAM, something happens that forces
        the character(s) on a journey. If that shit is good, the only thing I’m
        thinking is, “WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?!?” I’m hooked. It costs $5 bucks to
        watch the rest and everyone else says it’s good? Done. Even if I have to
        go to another platform to watch the rest of the movie, I’m sold. If I
        watched the first episode of a great TV show, I’d be sold. It’s free,
        and potentially infinitely scalable marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why wouldn’t every producer of visual stories post at least the first
        part of their story on Youtube? Because they are cowards. They want to
        sell their content trash to a handful of greater fools who don’t know
        any better. Those fools want to package that shit into their streaming
        platform or sell it in the form of a fancy trailer. The producers are
        afraid, and generally correctly, that their stories are so bad that if
        people were to see even the first act, they wouldn’t want to continue
        watching, let alone pay to watch.

      <p>Make the best shit. Put your shit out there and don’t be a coward.</p>
