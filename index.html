            to develop and visualize their story without technical limitations.
            They'll be able to direct a visual story by themselves. They'll be
            able to collaborate real time, building virtual scenes with people
            next to them or in different countries. They'll be able to iterate
            freely and easily to make their stories better.

            in the same country as the performers. As they shoot each shot, the
            scene will be roughly edited together, in real time. The technology
            will become invisible. They will only need to worry about the story
            and the performance.

            In the future, any person with a story idea will be able to produce
            their stories into full reality. They won't be restricted by where
            they came from or who they are now, but rather, empowered because of
            where they came from and who they are now. They won't worry about
            money or possessing technology. They will have a place to create
            stories, find others to work with, and find audiences that connect
            with their work. They will be free to play and explore creative story
            ideas ultimately creating visual stories with their most valuable
            asset: their unique point of view.

          <h2>1. Story Development</h2>
          <p>
            The story is the most important part of visual storytelling. Does that
            statement sound as basic to you as it feels for me to write it? I hope
            so, because it should be plain as day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Making stories is hard. It has been the same level hard for the past
            10,000 years. It will be the same level hard 10,000 years into the
            future. Technology may help with minor busywork annoyances, but the
            ability to contrive a story from nothing, infuse it with love and
            soul, solve it's infinite potential issues, and economically have an
            emotional impact on the viewer, all while seeming true and not
            contrived is a human miracle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certainly, you've seen a big budget movie where it was technically
            astounding, but the story just sucked. What's the point of burning
            tons of production cash if the story sucks? Why not wait until you
            have fully developed the story?
          </p>

          <p>Probably because making stories is hard, and people are lazy.</p>

          <p>
            Therefore, the development of the story should be the greatest
            interest of visual storytellers all the way through production, and
            even after it.
          </p>

          <h3>Writing Visually</h3>

          <p>
            If we consume visual stories as images, why would a writer use words
            to describe images to synthesize a story? Why not develop a story
            visually? Instead of writing with words, write with images.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's easy to understand why we write with words. We use collections of
            words as symbols to create ideas. We can speak and listen to words to
            communicate ideas. We can write words down and read them. We can
            easily mass distribute written words. Words are cheap and effective.
            But they are also lossy symbols. They can never exactly convey the
            true meaning and feeling of the writer. They require the writer to
            translate the idea to words, and the reader to translate the words to
            the idea. Those are two translations where the original idea can be
            confused.
          </p>

          <p>
            In animation, specifically at a company like Pixar, writers do, in
            fact, write with images. "Story Artists" draw sequences of images to
            convey stories. Storyboards. This is an incredibly effective way of
            conveying a story because the hand drawn images are very close to the
            desired end product. Story artists can visably explain ideas
            understood immediately, which would be very difficult to write in
            words. Image sequences also demonstrate timing, pacing and tone, which
            is often near impossible to do in words.
          </p>

          <p>
          The downside of drawing images to synthesize stories is that you need to
          be able to draw. However, I have been assured by many story artists that
          the important component of "Story Artist" is "Story". A great
          storyteller who has little drawing ability can put together stick figure
          drawings and is able to move a viewer emotionally. Conversely, a
          technically great illustrator with no clear idea of story often just
          makes hollow pretty pictures. Therefore, I believe great visual
          storytellers should be able to visually write without having the ability
          to draw. This is why we built Storyboarder. Initially, Storyboarder was
          built as a conventional storyboarding tool centered around illustration.
          Yet, computers have a great ability to render 3D scenes of environments,
          objects, and characters. So we built a tool that allows people to easily
          create scenes, pose characters and set up cameras so they can easily
          create images to tell stories. Furthermore, you can put on a VR headset
          to create and manipulate the whole scene just as you would in a real
          set. It essentially allows you to write and direct a story on the fly.
          Editing is very easy by going back into a scene and making changes.
          There isn't a sense of loss of throwing away a drawing – there is a
          sense of productivity and creativity by incrementally making things
          better. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31CdxnXAxiQ "Film stories are
          still really rooted in theater. You're frequently stuck doing things
          that you could do much more poetically. The story has to be written for
          it and I'm not quite sure who would do it because writers don't write
          visual things." – Stanley Kubrick With modern creative tools, it's now
          possible for writers to write visual things. So at this point, there is
          no reason why a visual storyteller should not be writing visually using
          a tool like Storyboarder or any other tool that works for them.
          Importance of Play All of the most creative things I've ever done have
          been by accident. I was trying something I didn't need to do because:
          why not? I was playing. With curiosity and wonder you take little low
          cost risks to see what will happen. You learn new things. Sometimes
          those things are fantastic. Sometimes you are the first person to
          discover something and often the first to discover it from your
          particular point of view. Keep the costs low and the creative risks
          high. When creating or doing something takes a lot of effort or has a
          big expense, we don't take small risks. We make plans. We make plans to
          make plans. We often spend more time trying to mitigate the potential
          disasters of the plan than actually executing. This limits happy
          accidents. This limits risk taking. This limits play. It's weird and sad
          how people don't play as they get older. Maybe it's because our bodies
          work slower. Maybe it's because we think we've already discovered
          everything. Maybe it's because we don't even remember the joy of
          discovery. Is it possible to live in the world of your story? Is it
          possible to act the scene out? When Walt Disney was developing the story
          of Snow White, he would grab a random employee from the halls and bring
          them to the theater. He would act out the full story of Snow White from
          his head. Every time was a little different. He would try different
          ideas and often improvise new ideas on the spot. He did this hundreds of
          times, coming up with tons of new ideas. Why not play the story out
          hundreds of times? Improvise new ideas because: why not? When the cost
          to try new ideas is low, and the technology and tooling blend into the
          background, you can reach a flow state. You are hyper focused on
          creation. You can try new things and you get immediate feedback. New
          ideas give you new ideas. The instant you have to wait for something,
          this is broken. When creation feels like a game, the stakes are low. The
          barrier is low. The risks are easy to take. The art is better.
          Collaboration Creativity is reactive. No one synthesizes a completely
          original idea without prompt. The conversations between people are
          people reacting to each others ideas. A question is asked for
          clarification. A person responds with a new thought they'd never thought
          of before. Another person brings a fact or prior art into the
          conversation sparking new ideas. Conversation and collaboration between
          people is an excellent tool for synthesizing new ideas. Yet, recent
          story development is thought of as a solitary act. The sole writer
          creates a unique, idiosyncratic story with their own take on dramatic
          conflict. A strong, unique point of view is absolutely necessary in a
          story. But why not benefit from multiple minds of similar style,
          interest and taste, each bringing their own strengths to the development
          of the story? With a strong central story director, the story can
          maintain the point of view, while incorporating the very best input from
          each writer. Additionally, collaborators don't need to be in the same
          place. In fact, it seems absurd to find creative, unique, talented
          people (which is near impossible), expecting they will all live in the
          same city. We have tools to coexist in virtual worlds together, walking
          around, playing, and creating together. You can do this within
          Storyboarder. community Music Sooner Than Later Some of the most
          beautiful stories are told through music. Some of the greatest memories
          are tied to iconic original themes. So why not develop a story with
          music as a fundamental writing tool in the first place? Music and
          thoughtful sound design have a huge impact on how people feel when they
          watch a visual story. Music can set the mood and tone through the usage
          of well known cliches. In fact, in the absence of a meaningful story,
          music is the only hope to keep that visual turd from sinking into the
          dark abyss of irrelevance. Iteration Iteration is easily the most
          important concept around the future of visual storytelling. I buried it
          down here because most people aren't even reading this far. But you are.
          Hey. Isn't this nice? Let's just take a moment to appreciate each other.
          Thanks for reading this. Anyways... No creation is great right out of
          the gate. It is made better over time. You listen to feedback. You
          change things. You try new things or gain a new perspective. You change
          things. Every iteration makes the work better. Iteration is how stories
          have historically developed. Myths would be created by someone and told
          to a group of people. People would retell the stories, keeping the best
          aspects of the story and losing the worst parts. Every time it was
          retold, it would be slightly different, each time, the story would be
          iterated on. The bible is a great example of a collection of
          prototypical myths iterating over several thousand years. All religious
          mythology and folklore is the result of this. In video game development,
          no game is just made and released to the public. When a game designer
          has a novel idea for a game, they are feeling pretty good that they are
          on to something. They make a prototype. They make something people can
          play and receive feedback on. This isn't done two or three times. This
          is done thousands of times. When the game is ready for release, perhaps
          a kernel of the vision is still intact, but the resulting game is very
          different from the way they originally intended. Even after release,
          changes are being made to improve the game. In feature-length narrative
          screenwriting, there is some sort of arbitrary "A draft and two
          revisions" rule of thumb. It seems to be centered around worker
          protectionism more than the work itself. But who really gives a shit
          about how screenwriting is typically done? Mythology has been iterating
          on iconic stories for 10,000 years. Screenwriting has only existed for
          roughly a hundred years and has produced only a handful of rare single
          hit successes. Yet in animation, particularly at Pixar, stories are
          heavily iterated on. Animation is much more expensive per minute to
          produce than live-action. Therefore, if you are going to spend a ton on
          production, you should invest in the story you are trying to produce.
          Stories at Pixar start with the kernel of an idea. The story is
          workshopped. Scenes are written by story artists that produce visual
          sequences to pitch story ideas to the team and the director. Because
          these hand drawn sequences can be edited into full versions of a movie,
          Pixar can show that version to test audiences and their trusted panel of
          storytellers for feedback. The feedback is taken and incorporated into
          revisions of sequences, or even wholly new ideas. This makes the stories
          better. Pixar stories are developed over the course of two years. Their
          story and commercial hit rate is nearly 100%. Even though Pixar
          literally invented computer graphics, their most valuable innovation has
          been how they iterate on story. I don't know why every storyteller or
          entertainment studio hasn't stolen their process. I think it is because
          Pixar originated as a group of creative software engineers. The value of
          technological iteration is burned into their culture. Whereas most other
          creative executives still cling to the golden touch fallacy. But
          iteration is hard particularly in visual storytelling because the costs
          are so high. Do you have 10 story artists at your disposal to visualize
          your story concepts? I don't. Furthermore, changes to stories have
          ripple effects. If you change a fundamental value of a character in the
          story, you have to make sure that change is reflected in the rest of the
          story. This problem increases exponentially based on the length of the
          story. Even worse, artists are resistant to losing their work. Imagine
          if you just drew a beautiful sequence of 300 images. But, a great change
          was made to a character that will improve the story. This will nullify
          your sequence and it must be redone. This is why we built Storyboarder.
          We wanted scenes and shots to be easily changed so that contrary to
          feeling loss while iterating story, you would feel a sense of
          improvement. A creative tool like Storyboarder will reduce the change
          costs so that iteration is pain free. Also, because the storyboard
          sequences generated with Storyboarder are very similar to the desired
          output (a visual story), full sequences of the entire visual story can
          be presented to test audiences for feedback. This can be done hundreds
          or thousands of times. 2. Pre-Production Pre-production is the stage
          where the story has been developed enough that it makes sense to move
          forward and prepare for production. However, this doesn't mean the story
          is done. Ideally, through the process working with the cast,
          workshopping the story, and further testing, the story will further
          develop prior to production. Through the step of proto-production, the
          story will be iterated on at least one more time. Casting There are a
          lot of great actors few people have seen yet. If your story is great,
          you do not need a well-known actor. If the cost of your production is
          low, you do not need a well-known actor to sell your story to viewers.
          Culturally, you want your actors on your team. You want them fully
          invested in the story. You want them to make your story ring true. You
          want them to be able to iterate on the story with you. You want them to
          make the story better. This will take more work than usually required of
          a typical narrative story. It's important that they are willing to do
          this.</p>
